My journey into **Data, AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning** has been a path of curiosity and growth.  
Starting with **data analytics**, I’ve explored key areas like **data cleaning, visualization, exploratory analysis, and storytelling** — using tools such as **Python, Power BI, Tbleau, Excel, Pandas, and SQL**.  

I’ve also learned how to draw insights from real-world datasets, interpret trends, and present findings that support decision-making.  
As I advanced, I explored **Artificial Intelligence** and its ability to create smarter, human-like systems.  
Through **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, I discovered how algorithms learn from data to make predictions and recognize complex patterns.  

Each concept has deepened my appreciation for technology and inspired me to keep learning, building, and contributing to meaningful AI innovations.
